    <p>
      This tool doesn't intent to rival EJB or OSGI, it brings only modularity to servlet based applications while others brings many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      However if offers local call with classloading sharing that EJB spec lacks, and is less coercing then OSGI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not every developper have the chance to work on new applications using latest technology and those doing
      maintenance on simple web applications will appreciate having this instrument in their toolbelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Futhermore it is a great satisfaction to accomplish what many others judged impossible !
